### In another life
I did an internship at a space + graphic design firm in Shanghai and absolutely loved my time there. I did a bunch of cool work and learned a lot. 

I created furniture and commercial display models in Google SketchUp (with true-to-size measurements) and created 3D renderings for our firm's clients in KeyShot. Here are some examples of what I did.

My first project was actually to come up with ideas for an atrium centerpiece in a major Shanghai mall (the Bund Finance Center). One of the ideas that was eventually accepted was a concept with floating LED display cubes that came together to show a large video, which was in physical production by the end of my internship. It was so cool to see my crazy ideas translated into the actual LED cubes that the manufacturer brought in. Some of my early concept diagrams:
