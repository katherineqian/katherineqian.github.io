Glowdex was a crowdsourcing platform for skincare recommendations. It aimed to reimagine the concept of online shopping reviews to give users access to *data-driven*, *authentic* information when shopping. Glowdex was incubated at the Harvard i-Labs.

I ran this startup as an indie hacker, so I covered the whole range of tasks from design to illustration to full-stack-eng to sales. I'll just give a few examples of my design + illustration work here, but I'd love to chat about engineering on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kathqi). We were built on Supabase (Postgres) + Next.js!

### Illustration + UX Design

### Social media graphics
The Glowdex Instagram account was originally focused on "review analysis" posts that I created. The challenge here was to present technical or data-heavy concepts in an engaging, aesthetically-pleasing way.

### Brand Identity
I designed the branding and a bunch of other assets for the Glowdex brand. It's abstract, modern, and youthful.

### Animations + renderings
Extra things I made include hand-drawn illustrations and 3D mockups to use in our decks. For example:
